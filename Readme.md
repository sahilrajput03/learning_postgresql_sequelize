### Learning postgres via sequelize

TODO: add seed data program as 00_seed_server.js.

1. model is an abstraction that represents a table
2. models have singular names (such as User) while tables have pluralized names (such as Users)
3. Note, from the usage of await in the snippet above, that save is an asynchronous method. In fact, almost every Sequelize method is asynchronous; build is one of the very few exceptions.
4. Data types: https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-basics.html#data-types
5. Created user and db with name chetan, and assign owner of chetan db as chetan user. Also, set chetan user's password as `66p`.
6. set alias for psql as winpty psql in fishbashrc file. Yikes!
7. Read about operators: https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#operators
8. Configure schemas from pgadmin via - mydb_test > Schemas > public > Tables > myTable > Columns. Yikes!
